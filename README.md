# Just_A_Dutchman_'s Library Files

This is my collection of files which I copy over to new projects if I need them. This README will provide you with additional information if needed on the library files



## Timer.lua

`Timer.lua` is a library file I use to time (parts of) my mods. For example, if I want to improve a mod, I make the new implementation and then time both of them to see which of them is faster. In general it is great to know how fast your program is, you might need to put some constraints on it.
